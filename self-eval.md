# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

This was the most challenging CFU so far and pushed me a lot. This was one of the first times that I was struggling enough to walk away and take a break. I wrote the code to the best of my ability and then I ended up asking for for help. I left the snippets of my original code that I ended up changing commented out in the file to show my progress. After receiving a push in the right direction, I was able to move on to the next class and use the new things that I learned.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I am happy with my workflow so far. During this CFU, I stepped away a few times to take a bio break, eat, and then once out of frustration. I was able to stay focused and engaged and I think this was due to taking a quick break when I wanted to instead of when I absolutely needed to.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I am going to try leaving my phone out of sight, close out of my email, and make sure notifications are muted. I can get sidetracked when I know I have something to "check out", especially when I am in a struggle phase. I also caught myself doing some negative self talk so I need to remind myself to stay positive. I will also need support in terms of basic needs such as food. I know that I do not work well when I am extra hungry/dehydrated, so meal prep and a partner that cooks the majority of the meals will be incredibly helpful.
